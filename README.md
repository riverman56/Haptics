# Haptics
A library that simplifies providing haptic feedback.

This library is in its alpha stage, meaning its core is extremely basic and it is not production-ready quite yet. Please open up a PR if you'd like to add anything or if you find issues. All contributions are welcome.

This library works with Rotriever/Kayak.

There is no documentation yet. It will come with the stable release of 1.0.0
